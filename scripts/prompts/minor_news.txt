## HARD FORMATTING RULES (the email renderer depends on these — breaking them causes layout bugs)

1. Separate paragraphs with one blank line (two newlines). The email template uses blank lines to create paragraph breaks.
2. Do NOT manually break lines within a paragraph — let text flow continuously. The email template converts single newlines to <br>, causing unwanted line breaks.
3. Separate news items with ─── (three em dashes), with one blank line before and after ───.
4. ⚡ and 📊 MUST be at the start of a line. The email template renders these as large section headers.
5. 📍 MUST be at the start of a line. The email template renders this as a small gray metadata line.
6. 💡 MUST be at the start of a line. The email template renders this as a styled analysis box with left border.
7. 🔗 MUST be at the start of a line, followed by a space and a bare URL (https://...). The email template renders this as a clickable source link. Do NOT wrap in markdown format.
8. Headlines use **double asterisks** for bold. The email template renders as bold text.
9. Bullet points use • (not -), one per line. The email template renders • as indented list items.
10. Do NOT output markdown code fences (```), do NOT output any non-content text.
11. "核心主题：" must be on its own line, followed by bullet items each starting with • on their own line.

## CONTENT RULES

1. Each news item MUST have all 5 parts: **headline**, 📍 line, summary paragraph, 💡 analysis, 🔗 source link
2. Headlines must be in Chinese, wrapped in **bold**
3. Location line format is FIXED: 📍 ... | 🏢 ... | #...
4. Summary: focus on facts and numbers. No fluff, no filler words.
5. Analysis (💡): give actionable insight. Connect to broader trends. What should the reader take away?
6. Source links: use real, plausible URLs from major energy/crypto/finance outlets (Bloomberg, Reuters, TheMinerMag, CoinTelegraph, etc.)
7. Cover diverse topics: bitcoin mining economics, data center construction, power grid policy, natural gas/electricity markets, renewable energy, regulatory changes
8. Core themes (核心主题) should use relevant emojis: 🔴 for negative/crisis, 💰 for finance, 🏗️ for construction, 🌀 for weather/grid, ⚡ for energy policy, 🔋 for storage, 🌍 for international
9. Write 800-1500 words total

## EXAMPLE NEWS ITEM:

**比特币挖矿难度暴跌11%，创2021年中国禁令以来最大降幅**

📍 美国/全球 | 🏢 Foundry USA, 各大矿企 | #BitcoinMining #PowerMarket #Grid

冬季风暴Fern席卷美国34个州，导致矿工被迫削减电力使用以稳定电网。全网算力过去30天下降约20%，Foundry USA矿池一度损失60%算力。比特币价格从12.6万美元高点暴跌超45%至约6万美元，矿工收益指标hashprice跌破30美元/PH/s，接近盈亏平衡线。

💡 挖矿难度下调11%将短期缓解矿工压力，但成本约8.7万美元/BTC而现货仅6.9万美元，意味着许多矿企正在亏损运营。预计更多矿企将转向AI数据中心业务。

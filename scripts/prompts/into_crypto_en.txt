🪙 Into Crypto | {{DATE}}

One sentence summarizing today's overall crypto market state.

───

1️⃣ Headline goes here

First paragraph: 2-3 sentences objectively describing what happened. Must include specific numbers (amounts, percentages, dates). No paragraph labels.

Second paragraph: Explain every term in this story that a beginner wouldn't understand. Readers may not know what ETFs, staking, Layer 2, stablecoins, mining difficulty, or gas fees are. Define each on first use. Use analogies only when they genuinely help — don't force them. Don't re-explain concepts already covered in another story.

Third paragraph: What does this mean? What's the impact on the industry or on regular people?

Worth thinking about:
• First question (first-principles, pushes independent reasoning)
• Second question (thought-provoking, not "what do you think?")

## HARD FORMATTING RULES (the email renderer depends on these — breaking them causes layout bugs)

1. Separate paragraphs with one blank line (two newlines). The email template uses blank lines to create paragraph breaks.
2. Do NOT manually break lines within a paragraph — let text flow continuously. The email template converts single newlines to <br>, causing unwanted line breaks.
3. Separate sections with ─── (three em dashes), with one blank line before and after ───.
4. Keycap emojis 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ MUST be at the start of a line, followed by a space and the headline text. The email template renders these as large section headers.
5. 📡 MUST be at the start of a line.
6. Bullet points use • (not -), one per line. The email template renders • as indented list items.
7. **Bold** uses double asterisks. The email template renders as bold text.
8. Links use [text](url) format. The email template renders as clickable links.
9. Standalone 🔗 links: just write 🔗 https://url — no markdown format needed.
10. Do NOT output markdown code fences (```), do NOT output any non-content text.
11. "Worth thinking about:" must be on its own line, followed by questions each starting with • on their own line.

## CONTENT RULES

1. The 3 main stories MUST cover different topics
2. Topic priority: regulation/policy > major market events > tech upgrades > industry trends
3. Explain key concepts generously — ETFs, staking, Layer 2, stablecoins, mining difficulty, gas fees, etc. Define each on first use. Don't re-explain across stories
4. Do NOT pad with filler. No "shaking the market", "sparking debate"
5. Do NOT use narrative openings. No "In today's ever-changing landscape..."
6. Numbers must be specific: "rose 23% to $95,000", not "surged significantly"
7. Quick Hits: 5-10 items, more crypto-native — protocol updates, on-chain data, DeFi activity, NFT, DAO governance
8. Total length: 1000-1500 words

Write today's Into Crypto daily report for {{DATE}}.

Target reader: Complete beginners who know nothing about crypto or even finance in general.
Goal: Explain 3 trending crypto news stories in the simplest language, explain every key concept, and inspire deep thinking.

## STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT

### HEADER:

🪙 Into Crypto | {{DATE}}

One sentence summarizing today's overall crypto market state (price, sentiment, key event).

───

### THREE MAIN STORIES (use 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣):

1️⃣ [headline]

[2-3 sentences objectively describing what happened. Include specific numbers.]

[Explanation paragraph: explain every term a beginner wouldn't understand. Readers may not know what an ETF is, what staking means, what Layer 2 is, what a stablecoin does. Explain each term when it first appears. Use analogies only when they genuinely help — don't force them. Make sure the same concept is NOT re-explained across the three stories. Lean heavily into explaining crypto concepts — don't hold back.]

[Analysis paragraph: what does this mean? What's the impact on the industry or on regular people?]

Worth thinking about:
• [A first-principles question that pushes the reader to reason independently — not "what do you think?"]
• [Another thought-provoking question]

🔗 [source URL]

───

2️⃣ [headline]

[same format as above]

───

3️⃣ [headline]

[same format as above]

### QUICK HITS (5-10 items, more crypto-native):

📡 Quick Hits

• [Protocol/Project] — [one-line description] [🔗](url)
• [Protocol/Project] — [one-line description] [🔗](url)
...repeat 5-10 times

## CONTENT RULES

1. Do NOT add bold headers like "What happened:" or "What this means:" before paragraphs — just write the content directly
2. The 3 main stories MUST cover different topics
3. Explain key concepts generously — readers may not know what ETFs, staking, Layer 2, stablecoins, mining difficulty, or gas fees are. Explain each term on first use. But do NOT re-explain the same concept across stories
4. Use analogies only when they genuinely clarify. Don't force analogies where none are needed
5. Do NOT pad with filler words. No "shaking the market", "sparking debate", "worth watching"
6. Do NOT be narrative. No "In today's ever-changing landscape..." openings
7. Numbers must be specific: don't say "surged significantly", say "rose 23% to $95,000"
8. "Worth thinking about" questions must be first-principles, thought-provoking. Each question gets its own bullet point (•)
9. Every main story MUST have a 🔗 source link at the bottom
10. Quick Hits section should be more crypto-native / degen: protocol updates, on-chain data, DeFi activity, NFT events, DAO governance, etc.
11. Quick Hits links use inline markdown format [🔗](url)
12. Do NOT include "Word of the Day" or any closing summary
13. Total length: 1000-1500 words
14. Use ─── (three em dashes) as the ONLY separator between sections
15. Do NOT output markdown code fences or ```

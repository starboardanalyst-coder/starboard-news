## CONTENT RULES

1. The 3 stories MUST cover different topics — no overlapping themes
2. Topic priority: regulation/policy > major market events > tech upgrades > industry trends
3. Do NOT pad with filler words. No "shaking the market", "sparking debate", "worth watching"
4. Do NOT be narrative. No "In today's ever-changing landscape..." openings
5. Every concept explanation MUST include an analogy. Example: "Staking is like a fixed deposit — you lock up your money for a set period in exchange for interest"
6. "Think about this" questions must have depth. Don't ask "What do you think?" — ask questions that push the reader to reason through tradeoffs
7. Numbers must be specific: don't say "surged significantly", say "rose 23% to $95,000"
8. "Word of the Day" should be a term that appeared in today's stories that beginners might not know
9. Total length: 800-1200 words
10. Use ─── (three em dashes) as the ONLY separator between sections
11. Do NOT output markdown code fences, do NOT output ```, do NOT output any non-content text
